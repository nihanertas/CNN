# CNN
Convolutional Neural Network

# DESCRIPTION
In this study, Convulutional Neural Network (CNN) which is called Deep Learning algorithm applies image classification through CIFAR-10 in order to compare our models results. The results of the proposed models in terms of accuracy and loss values in the test data according to the data sets used are shown graphically when the models complete the test on the basis of the optimum epoch numbers.
